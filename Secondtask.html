    <h1>Hello, welcome to my little space </h1>
    <h2>Here is a few things to know about me</h2>
    <p>my name is Chidinma Nwodo, and I'm excited to share a bit about myself.
        I'm really passionate about a bunch of things, but if there's one thing I absolutely love, it's spending money!</p>
        <p>Currently, I'm working in Customer Service, and while helping people is super fulfilling, I felt the urge to challenge myself even more.</p>
            <p>That's why I decided to enroll in Genesys upskill program in web development. Can't wait to see where this journey takes me!</p>
            <p>Wow, my first web development class was a rollercoaster! It started off a bit rocky with our instructor battling microphone issues, and as a newbie in the coding realm, I felt completely lost.</p>
            <h3>But you know what saved the day?</h3>  <p>Recorded videos and YouTube tutorials came to the rescue!. Despite the initial hurdles, I'm finding this journey incredibly thrilling and full of promise.</p>
                <h4>My expections from the upskill'24 program</h4>
                <p>I have high expectations of gaining a foundational understanding in web development, which I believe will pave the way for an internship opportunity in the QA field. My focus is set on honing my skills in this area</p>
